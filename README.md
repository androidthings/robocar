Android Things Robocar
============

Introduction
------------
This project contains all the code required to build a robot car that runs on
[Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html), as well as a companion "controller" Android app.

This sample uses the following Google platforms and APIs:

- [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html) - The car's onboard operating system.
- [Nearby APIs](https://developers.google.com/nearby/) - Local communication API used
for pairing the robocar to a companion app which controls the car.

> **Note:** The Android Things Console will be turned down for non-commercial
> use on January 5, 2022. For more details, see the
> [FAQ page](https://developer.android.com/things/faq).

Pre-requisites
--------------
To build the car, you will need the following hardware:

- An [Android-Things powered device](https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/developer-kits.html) with a connected camera.  This demo ran on a Raspberry Pi 3, but is in no way limited to that device.

- A robot car chassis.  We had great luck with the [Runt rover robotics kit](https://www.amazon.com/Actobotics-Junior-Runt-Rover/dp/B00UAWVC64).

- A power source.  The developer board and DC motors each need their own power input, so you can either get two small power packs or something like the [Anker Powercore 13000](https://smile.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-13000-Portable-Charger/dp/B00Z9QVE4Q/), which has two USB-out ports.

- The [Adafruit stepper & DC Motor hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348), for controlling the motors.

(Optional)
To assist in distinguishing between multiple robocars during the pairing process, the robocar also supports alphanumeric displays or RGB LED's for displaying a pairing code.  Note that this is meant to _assist_ the user,
and is not intended or sufficient as a security measure.  If you'd like to add these to your setup, you'll need:

- [A quad alphanumeric display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1912)

- [An RGB Led](https://www.adafruit.com/product/159)

- [A half-size breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/64)

Enable auto-launch behavior
---------------------------

This Android Things app is currently configured to launch only when deployed from your
development machine. To enable the main activity to launch automatically on boot,
add the following `intent-filter` to the app's manifest file:

```xml
<activity ...>

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    </intent-filter>

</activity>
```
